# Ethereal

#### What is this?

**Ethereal** is an email testing platform for [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/). You can generate a vanity email account right from Nodemailer, send an email using that account just like you would use any other email sending service and finally preview the sent message here as no emails are actually delivered, all messages are stored to the Ethereal account and no message never leaves the system.

**Inbound**

The same account acts as a real inbound email address. You can send emails to that address from anywhere and these messages also end up on the account.

**IMAP**

The coolest feature out of all Ethereal features is that vanity email accounts act as real IMAP / POP3 accounts. You can access sent and received messages using your favorite email client, whatever that happens to be.

#### How to register?

You can create new accounts straight from Nodemailer. Use the username and password of the generated account to log in here as well.

#### How long are the messages stored?

All messages expire after 7 days.
