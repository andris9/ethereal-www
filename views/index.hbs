        <strong>Ethereal Email</strong> is testing platform for <a href="https://nodemailer.com/">Nodemailer</a>. It's an anti-transactional email service where messages never get delivered.</p>
        <p>Instead, you can generate a vanity email account right from Nodemailer, send an email using that account just as you would use any other SMTP service and finally preview the sent message here as no emails are actually delivered, all messages are stored to the Ethereal Email account and no message never leaves the system.

  <h2>IMAP/POP3</h2>
  <p>Ethereal email addresses act as real IMAP/POP3 accounts. You can access sent and received messages using your favorite email client, whatever that happens to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
  <h2>Inbound</h2>
  <p>The same account acts as a real inbound email address. You can send emails to that address from anywhere and these messages also end up on the account mailbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
  <h2>Automatic</h2>
  <p>All account registration is handled from the Nodemailer API. If you have lost authentication details for a previous account, then just create a new one.</p>
