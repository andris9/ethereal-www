    <p class="lead">
        <strong>Ethereal</strong> is a fake SMTP service, mostly aimed at <a href="https://nodemailer.com/">Nodemailer</a> users (but not limited to). It's a completely free anti-transactional email service where messages never get delivered.</p>
        <p>Instead, you can generate a vanity email account right from Nodemailer, send an email using that account just as you would with any other SMTP provider and finally <a href="/message/WaZ4Au2XiUYoPu0MWaZ5d1yRazGkcu0lAAAAAQvjbRo.YQsBidMcHxC5Tqg">preview</a> the sent message here as no emails are actually delivered, all messages are stored to the Ethereal account and no message never leaves the system. So far Ethereal has catched <span title="From {{accounts}} test accounts" style="font-weight: bold">{{messages}}</span> emails sent using Ethereal testing accounts.

  <h2>IMAP/POP3</h2>
  <p>Ethereal addresses act as real IMAP/POP3 accounts. You can access sent and received messages using your favorite email client, whatever that happens to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
  <h2>Inbound</h2>
  <p>The same account acts as a real inbound email address. You can send emails to that address from anywhere and these messages also end up on the account mailbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
  <h2>Automatic</h2>
  <p>All account registration is handled from the Nodemailer API. If you have lost authentication details for a previous account, then just create a new one.</p>
